#### Workshops

| Workshop     | Crafting Materials                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Fruit Salad Workshop | Wood x2, Stone x2, Apple, Berry |
| Milkshake Workshop    | Wood x2, Stone x2, Milk, Berry |
| Stick Workshop       | Wood x2, Stone x2, Villager, Stick       |
| Shed Workshop        | Wood x3, Stone x2, Villager, Stone, Stick |
| Warehouse Workshop   | Wood x2, Stone x3, Villager, Iron Block   |

I believe that workshops require human labor to function, so you need to assign a villager to a workshop in order to make it operate.

The construction materials for all workshops follow a general formula:

> All require "Wood x2, Stone x2, Villager, Finished Material" to be built.

For example, for the "Fruit Salad Workshop," the raw materials for a fruit salad are "Apple, Berry." Adding the common materials "Wood x2, Stone x2, Villager," the crafting materials for it are:

> Wood x2, Stone x2, Villager, Apple, Berry
